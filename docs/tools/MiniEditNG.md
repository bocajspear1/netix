# MiniEditNG

MiniEditNG rework of the original MiniEdit in the Mininet project. It has a few quality-of-life improvements to make it better to use.

You can find MiniEditNG by using the application menu `Internet > MiniEditNG` or running `sudo minieditng`.

## sudo Privileges

Note that regardless of how you start MiniEditNG, you will need to run as root. The application shortcut brings up a terminal with the sudo prompt ready for you. Be sure to keep that terminal window open.
