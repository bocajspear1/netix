# Getting Nettux

## Prebuilt Image

An image built in VirtualBox is available as an [OVA here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18k6VMuVmQZCQtDrEQaLcvU9W4-dUkstX/view?usp=sharing).

The default credentials are `nettux:nettux`. Use `nettux` for sudo privileges as well.

## Building your Own

1. Install Ubuntu 22.04 of your preferred flavor (I like [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/)). Don't install server!
2. Git clone the project's repository to the VM.
3. Run the `./install.sh` script.
